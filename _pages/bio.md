I am a research scientist in the Information Security and Privacy group at CSIRO. 
I am currently working on federated learning and privacy enhanced analytics for graph databases,
and secure and efficient data linkage techniques for large databases. 

In my PHD research study I developed scalable techniques for efficient and effective indexing mechanisms in 
PPRL for multiple parties.

## Research and Teaching Interests 
Data mining, record linkage, privacy-preserved record linkage, Big data, scalable indexing, health analytics, data analytics, educational data mining, Secure multi-party computation, crime analytics.
