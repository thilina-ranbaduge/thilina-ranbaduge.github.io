I am a research fellow in the Research School of Computer Science at the Australian National University (ANU). 
I am currently working on temporal privacy-preserving record linkage techniques (PPRL) for multiple parties. 
PPRL is the problem of identifying matching records from different databases that correspond to the same 
real-world entities without compromising privacy of the entities represented by those records. 

In my PHD research study I developed scalable techniques for efficient and effective indexing mechanisms in 
PPRL for multiple parties.
