<ul>
  <li>I am a research fellow in the <a href="https://cecs.anu.edu.au/">Research School of Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/">Australian National University (ANU)</a>.</li>
  <li>My current research lies towards working on temporal privacy-preserving record linkage techniques (PPRL) for multiple parties, the development of secure encoding techniques for efficient and
effective record linkage across different organisations, and development of provably secure linkage techniques for graph
databases.</li> 
<li>My research interests are privacy in data mining and matching, multidatabase integration, and privacy-preserving linkage of heterogeneous databases.</li>
